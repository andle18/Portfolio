          I have completed hands-on training focused on modern frontend
          development, working extensively with React and its ecosystem. My
          experience includes building applications using React with hooks,
          component-based architecture, and state management solutions such as
          Zustand. I have worked with TypeScript to improve code quality and
          maintainability, including schema validation with Zod. I am familiar
          with handling server data and API consumption using tools like React
          Query, as well as implementing client-side routing with React Router.
          I have also been introduced to Next.js concepts, including client-side
          and server-side rendering, and have experience integrating Firebase
          services for authentication and data storage. This training has
          allowed me to build real-world oriented projects while following clean
          code practices and focusing on usability and performance.
